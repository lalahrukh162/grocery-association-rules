ðŸ›’ Grocery Association Rules Mining

This project applies Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms to identify frequent itemsets and generate association rules from a grocery dataset. These techniques help discover which products are commonly purchased together, providing valuable insights for marketing and inventory management.


ðŸ“Š Dataset
 
Source: [Kaggle - Groceries Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heeraldedhia/groceries-dataset)  
- Attributes:
  - MEMBER: Buyer ID  
  - DATE: Purchase date  
  - ITEMS: List of purchased items  



 ðŸš€ Algorithms Used
 âœ… Apriori  
 âœ… FP-Growth  

Both algorithms are used to find frequent itemsets and generate association rules based on specified support and confidence thresholds.
